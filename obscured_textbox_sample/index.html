          HMS Levant was a 28-gun sixth-rate frigate of the Coventry class, which saw Royal Navy
          service against France in the Seven Years' War, and against France, Spain and the American
          colonies during the American Revolutionary War. Principally a hunter of privateers, she
          was also designed to be a match for small French frigates, but with a broader hull and
          sturdier build at the expense of some speed and manoeuvrability. Launched in 1758, Levant
          was assigned to the Royal Navy's Jamaica station from 1759 and proved her worth in
          defeating nine French vessels during her first three years at sea. She was also part of
          the British expedition against Martinique in 1762 but played no role in the landings or
          subsequent defeat of French forces at Fort Royal.

          The frigate was decommissioned following Britain's declaration of peace with France in
          1763, but returned to service in 1766 for patrol duties in the Caribbean. Decommissioned
          for a second time in 1770, she was reinstated at the outbreak of the American
          Revolutionary War and sent to the Mediterranean as part of a small British squadron based
          at Gibraltar. Over the next three years she captured or sank a total of fourteen enemy
          craft including an 18-gun American privateer. In 1779 she brought home news of an
          impending Spanish assault on Gibraltar, ahead of Spain's declaration of war on Great
          Britain.

          The ageing frigate was finally removed from Navy service later that year, and her crew
          discharged to other vessels. She was broken up at Deptford Dockyard in 1780, having
          secured a total of 31 victories over 21 years at sea.

          Levant was an oak-built 28-gun sixth rate, one of 19 vessels forming part of the Coventry
          class of frigates. As with others in her class she was loosely modelled on the design and
          dimensions of HMS Tartar, launched in 1756 and responsible for capturing five French
          privateers in her first twelve months at sea. Orders from Admiralty to build the
          Coventry-class vessels were made after the outbreak of what was later called the Seven
          Years' War, at a time when the Royal Dockyards were fully engaged in constructing or
          fitting-out the Navy's ships of the line. Consequently, and despite some Navy Board
          misgivings, contracts for most Coventry-class vessels were issued to private shipyards,
          with an emphasis on rapid completion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The contract for Levant's construction were issued on 20 May 1757 to shipwright Henry
          Adams of Buckler's Hard in Hampshire. It was stipulated that work should be completed
          within ten months for the 28-gun vessel measuring approximately 586 tons burthen. Subject
          to satisfactory completion, Adams would receive a comparatively modest fee of £9.5s per
          ton to be paid through periodic imprests drawn against the Navy Board. As private
          shipyards were not subject to rigorous naval oversight, the Admiralty also granted
          authority for "such alterations withinboard as shall be judged necessary" in order to
          cater to the preferences or ability of individual shipwrights.
        </p>
        <p>
          After consultation with Admiralty, Adams took advantage of this freedom to make four
          substantive changes to the Tartar design. The ship's wheel was moved from behind the
          mizzen mast to before it to improve the helmsman's line of sight. The tiller was
          relocated, from an exposed position on the quarterdeck to a safer location belowdecks and
          near the stern. The vessel's hawseholes were relocated from the lower to the upper deck to
          allow additional storage space inside the hull. Finally, in recognition of the vessel's
          likely role in chasing small enemy craft, the leading pair of gunports were moved from the
          sides of the vessel to the bow in order to form a battery of chase guns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Levant's keel was laid down in June 1757 but work proceeded slowly and the vessel was not
          ready for launch until July 1758. As built, Levant was 118 ft 5 in (36.1 m) long with a 97
          ft 4 in (29.7 m) keel, a beam of 33 ft 11 in (10.34 m), and a hold depth of 10 ft 6 in
          (3.2 m). After Adams' modifications, she was of 595 ​34⁄94 tons burthen, nearly ten
          tons more than the figure specified in the contract. Her armament comprised 24
          nine-pounder cannon located along her gun deck, supported by four three-pounder cannon on
          the quarterdeck and twelve ​1⁄2-pounder swivel guns ranged along her sides. The
          Admiralty-designated complement was 200, comprising two commissioned officers – a captain
          and a lieutenant – overseeing 40 warrant and petty officers, 91 naval ratings, 38 Marines
          and 29 servants and other ranks. Among these other ranks were four positions reserved for
          widow's men – fictitious crew members whose pay was intended to be reallocated to the
          families of sailors who died at sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vessel was named after the Levant, an area of the eastern Mediterranean. This
          continued a Board of Admiralty tradition, dating to 1644, of naming ships for geographic
          features. Overall, ten of the nineteen Coventry-class vessels, including Levant, were
          named after well-known regions, rivers or towns. With few exceptions the remainder of the
          class were named after figures from classical antiquity, following a more modern trend
          initiated in 1748 by John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, in his capacity as First Lord of
          the Admiralty. In sailing qualities Levant was comparable with French frigates of
          equivalent size, but with a shorter and sturdier hull and greater weight in her broadside
          guns. She was also comparatively broad-beamed which, when coupled with Adams'
          modifications, provided ample space for provisions, the ship's mess and a large magazine
          for powder and round shot. Taken together, these characteristics enabled Levant to remain
          at sea for long periods without resupply. She was built with broad and heavy masts, which
          balanced the weight of her hull, improved stability in rough weather and made her capable
          of carrying more sail. The disadvantages of this heavy design were a decline in
          manoeuvrability and slower speed in light winds.
